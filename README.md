# Used-Bike-Price-EDA
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a used bike dataset to uncover insights into price-influencing factors such as bike brand, age, seller type, and kilometers driven. The goal is to understand the data distribution, detect patterns, and build a simple machine learning model to predict the selling price of a used bike.
